# Color Palette Generator

This app is a React color palette generator similar to the one found here: https://coolors.co

When completed thisk app will:
1) Have a "Randomize Colors" button
2) Show 5 colors on the screen
3) Each color will have a hex code and a "LOCK/UNLOCK" button
4) Clicking the "Randomize Colors" buton should only randomize the colors of the unlocked sections

An example of how this will be designed can be found here: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/LqXPbB?editors=1000
